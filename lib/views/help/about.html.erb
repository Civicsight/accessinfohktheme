  <p>Everyone has the right under the Code of Access to Information to ask for and receive access to information held by the Hong Kong government. <a class="target-new" href="http://www.access.gov.hk">Read more about the Code on Access to Information here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>accessinfo.hk aims to make requesting for information under the Hong Kong government's <a href="http://www.access.gov.hk">Code on Access to Information</a> easier, more transparent, and hopefully fairer by publishing Access to Information requests and replies so that others don't have to ask for the same information again. These can then be scrutinized by the public, especially when these are unfair.
  </p>
  <p>Try <a href="/select_authority">making a request now</a>, or <a href="/list/successful">see which requests have already been successfully made</a> to understand the process better. If you want more information about how to make a request, <a href="/help/requesting">please read this</a>.

    <dt id="purpose">What is <%= site_name %> for? <a href="#purpose">#</a> </dt>
    <dd>To help you find out inside information about what the Hong Kong government
      is doing.

    <dt id="premise">How does the site work? <a href="#premise">#</a> </dt>
    <dd>You choose the public authority that you would like information from, then
      write a brief note describing what you want to know. We then send your request
      to the public authority. Any response they make is automatically published on the
      website for you and anyone else to find and read.
    </dd>

    <dt id="whybother_me">Why would I bother to do this? <a href="#whybother_me">#</a> </dt>
    <dd>You pay taxes, and then government does things with the money. All sorts of
      things that affect your life, from healthcare through to housing. Some
      it does badly, some it does well. The more we find out about how government
      works, the better able we are to make suggestions to improve the things that
      are done badly, and to celebrate the things that are done well.
    </dd>

    <dt id="whybother_them">Why would the public authority bother to reply? <a href="#whybother_them">#</a> </dt>
    <dd>Under the <a href="http://www.access.gov.hk">Code on Access to Information</a>, they have to respond. The response
      will either contain the information you want, or give a valid legal reason why
      it must be kept confidential.
    </dd>

    <dt id="reporting">What if I see a request I feel to be inappropriate? <a href="#reporting">#</a></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        Requests for personal information, vexatious requests and requests which would harm or prejudice Hong Kong's defence and security are not considered valid for FOI purposes (<a href="https://www.access.gov.hk/en/codeonacctoinfo/part2.html">read more</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        If you believe a request is not suitable, you can report it for attention by the site administrators.
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt id="reporting_unavailable">Why won't it let me report some requests? <a href="#reporting_unavailable">#</a></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        If a request has already been reported to the site administrators, you
        can't report it a second time - this is to prevent the administrators
        being notified multiple times about the same issue before they've had
        a chance to conduct a review.
      </p>

      <p>
        Where a request has been previously reported but an administrator has
        chosen not to hide it from public view, you can use the form in the
        sidebar of the request page to contact the administrators if you still
        think it should be hidden.
