      <p>It can be hard to untangle government's complicated structure, and work out
        who holds the information that you want. Here are a few tips:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Browse or search <%= site_name %> looking for similar requests to yours.</li>
        <li>When you've found an authority you think might have the information, use
          the "home page" link on the right hand side of their page to check what they do
          on their website.</li>
        <li>Contact the authority by phone or email to ask if they hold the kind of
          information you're after.</li>
        <li>Don't worry excessively about getting the right authority. If you get it
          wrong, they ought to advise you who to make the request to instead.
        </li>
        <li>If you've got a thorny case, please <a href="<%= help_contact_path %>">contact us</a> for help.</li>

      <p>Please <a href="<%= new_change_request_path %>">contact us</a> with the name of the public authority and,
        if you can find it, their contact email address for Freedom of Information requests.

        <li> Those formally subject to the Environmental Regulations (a less well
          defined group)</li>

    <dd>

      <p>
        Please put in your request only what is needed so that someone can
        easily identify what information you are asking for. Please do
        <i>not</i> include any of the following:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>arguments about your cause</li>
        <li>statements that could defame or insult others</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you do, we may have to remove your request to avoid problems with

        make it easier for authorities to be clear what information you are
        requesting, which means you will get a reply more quickly.

        If you want information to support an argument or campaign, Freedom of
        Information is a powerful tool. Although you may not use this site to
        run your campaign, we encourage you to use it to get the information you
        need. We also encourage to run your campaign elsewhere - one effective
        and very easy way is to <%= link_to 'start your own blog',
          "http://wordpress.com/"%>.
        <% if AlaveteliConfiguration::enable_annotations %>

    <dt id="fees">Does it cost me anything to make a request?<a href="#fees">#</a> </dt>

    <dd>

      <p>Making an FOI request is nearly always free.</p>

      <p>Authorities often include unnecessary, scary, boilerplate in
        acknowledgement messages saying they "may" charge a fee. Ignore such notices.
        They hardly ever will actually charge a fee.  If they do, they can only charge you if
        you have specifically agreed in advance to pay.  <a
        href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/library/freedom_of_information/practical_application/chargingafee.pdf">More
        details</a> from the Information Commissioner.
      </p>

      <p>Sometimes an authority will refuse your request, saying that the cost
        of handling it exceeds £600 (for central government) or £450 (for all other
        public authorities). At this point you can refine your
        request. e.g. it would be much cheaper for an authority to tell you the amount
        spent on marshmallows in the past year than in the past ten years.
      </p>

    <dt id="quickly_response">How quickly will I get a response? <a href="#quickly_response">#</a> </dt>

    <dd>
      <p>By law, public authorities must respond <strong>promptly</strong> to
        requests.
      </p>

      <p>Even if they are not prompt, in nearly all cases they must respond within
        20 working days. If you had to clarify your request, or they are a school,
        or one or two other cases, then they may have more time
        (<a href="<%= help_officers_path(:anchor => 'days') %>">full details</a>).
      </p>
      <p><%= site_name %> will email you if you don't get a timely response.  You can

    </dd>

    <dt id="no_response">What if I never get a response?<a href="#no_response">#</a> </dt>

    <dd>
      <p>There are several things you can do if you never get a response.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sometimes there has been a genuine problem and the authority never
          received the request. It is worth telephoning the authority and politely
          checking that they received the request. It was sent to them by email.
        </li>
        <li>If they have not received it, the problem is most likely due to
          "spam filters". Refer the authority to the measures in the answer
          '<a href="<%= help_officers_path(:anchor => 'spam_problems') %>">I can see a request on <%= site_name %>, but we never got it by email!</a>'
          in the FOI officers section of this help.
        </li>
        <li>If you're still having no luck, then you can ask for an internal review,
          and then complain to the Information Commissioner about the authority.
          Read our page '<a href="<%= help_general_path(:action => 'unhappy') %>">Unhappy about the response you got?</a>'.

    </dd>

    <dt id="reuse">It says I can't re-use the information I got!<a href="#reuse">#</a> </dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Authorities often add legal boilerplate about the

          Information Regulations 2005</a>", which at first glance implies you may not
        be able do anything with the information.
      </p>

      <p>You can, of course, write articles about the information or summarise it, or
        quote parts of it. We also think you should feel free to republish the
        information in full, just as we do, even though in theory you might not be
        allowed to do so.  See <a href="<%= help_officers_path(:anchor => 'copyright') %>">our policy on copyright</a>.</p>

        pages on the Information Commissioner's website.</p>

      <p>If you're requesting information from a Scottish public authority,
        the process is very similar. There are differences around time
        limits for compliance.
        See the <a href="http://www.itspublicknowledge.info/nmsruntime/saveasdialog.asp?lID=1858&amp;sID=321">Scottish

    <dt id="data_protection">Can I request information about myself? <a href="#data_protection">#</a> </dt>

    <dd>
      <p>No. Requests made using <%= site_name %> are public, made under the Freedom of
        Information Act, and cannot help you find information about a private
        individual.</p>

      <p>If you would like to know what information a public
        authority holds about yourself, you should make a "Subject Access Request" in
        private using Data Protection law.  The leaflet "<a
        href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/library/data_protection/introductory/subject_access_rights.pdf">How to access your information</a>" (on the Information Commissioner's
        website) explains how to do this.</p>

      <p>You should contact the public authority directly if you would like to

      <p>Some public authorities, such as <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/body/south_east_water">South East Water</a>,
        don't come under the Freedom of Information Act, but do come under another law called
        the Environmental Information Regulations (EIR).
      </p>

      <p>It's a very similar law, so you make a request
        to them using <%= site_name %> in just the same way as an FOI request. The only
        difference is that on the page where you write your request, it reminds you
        that you can only request "environmental information" and tells you what that
        means. It is quite broad.
      </p>

      <p>You can, of course, request environmental information from other
        authorities. Just make a Freedom of Information (FOI) request as normal. The
        authority has a duty to work out if the Environmental Information Regulations
        (EIR) is the more appropriate legislation to reply under.

<ul>
<li>Browse or search <%= site_name %>

<dt id="missing_body">You're missing the department that I want to request from! <a href="#missing_body">#</a> </dt>

<p>If the department is one of the <a href="http://www.access.gov.hk/en/code.htm#annexa">Departments to which the Codeon Access to Information applies</a> then please contact us with the name of the department and,
if you can find it, their contact email address for Code on Access to Information requests.
</p>

<dt id="focused">Why must I keep my request focused? <a href="#focused">#</a> </dt>

<p>
Please put in your request only what is needed so that someone can
easily identify what information you are asking for. Please do
<i>not</i> include any of the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>arguments about your cause</li>
<li>statements that could defame or insult others</li>
<li>questions or requests for comment rather than for specific information</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you include extraneous material,
we may have to remove your request to avoid problems with
libel law, which is a pain for both you and us.
</p>

<p>
The site is only for hosting requests under the Code on Access to Information, not for general correspondence
with public authorities. Phrasing your request as a question or a request
for comment (e.g. "why are you doing X?" or "please
explain why you are doing X") makes it more likely that your message
will not be seen as a valid request, both by us and by the department.  Asking for "copies of all policies and procedures
regarding X" would, on the other hand, normally result in a valid request.

Remember: You are asking for records already held by the government. 
</p>

<p>
Short, succinct messages
make it easier for authorities to be clear what information you are
requesting, which means you will get a reply more quickly.

<dt id="fees">Does it cost me anything to make a request? <a href="#fees">#</a> </dt>

<p><a href="http://www.access.gov.hk/en/code.htm#charges">Section 1.24 of the Code states in its entirety:</a></p>
<blockquote>Processing requests for information uses resources and departments may therefore require payment for this service. Any charges levied will reflect the cost of providing the information, and the information will not be released until the requisite payment has been made.</blockquote>

<p>The only charges explicitly mentioned on the <a href="http://www.access.gov.hk/">Code on Access to Information</a> website are <a href="http://www.access.gov.hk/en/charges.htm">photocopying charges</a> of $1.1 per copy (A4 size) and $1.3 per copy (A3 size).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.access.gov.hk/doc/guidelines.pdf">guidelines</a> state that </p>
<blockquote> 
1.24.1 The policy of openness in government requires that charges for 
information provided in accordance with the Code be simple and inexpensive.  
Paragraph 1.24 reflects this, but is deliberately phrased in flexible terms to allow for 
adjustments to the charging regime.  Successful applicants for access to information 
should only be charged for the cost of reproducing the required documents, etc. at the 
current standard charge where one exists.</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
 
1.24.2 In all cases, applicants should be informed in advance how much they 
will have to pay for copies of documents they are seeking.  It is then their choice to 
pursue or abandon the request.  Departments are required to publish or make 
available for inspection a schedule of current reproduction charges. 
 </blockquote>


<dt id="format">Will I get the information in the format I want? <a href="#format">#</a> </dt>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.access.gov.hk/en/code.htm#responses">Code</a> states that 
<blockquote>So far as possible, information will be provided in the form in which it exists. Where disclosure of certain information in a record is to be refused, access will normally be provided to the remaining part of the record.</blockquote>
</p>




<dt id="quickly_response">How quickly will I get a response? <a href="#quickly_response">#</a> </dt>

<p>The Code states that
<blockquote>1.16 Where possible, information will be made available within ten [calendar] days of receipt of a written request. If that is not possible the applicant will be so advised by an interim reply within ten days of receipt of the request. The target response time will then be twenty-one days from receipt of the request.</blockquote>
</p>
and
<blockquote>1.18 Response may be deferred beyond twenty-one days only in exceptional circumstances, which should be explained to the applicant. Any deferral should not normally exceed a further thirty days.</blockquote>

<p>The guidelines state that 51 days is the maximum for a "complicated request", only in "exceptional circumstances", for example "the need to seek legal advice on a request", or "the need for an extensive search of files in order to meet the request".</p>
